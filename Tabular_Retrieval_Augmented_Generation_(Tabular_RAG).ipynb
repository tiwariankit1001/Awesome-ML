        "Welcome back, and congratulations on mastering the foundational concepts of Tabular RAG from our first session! You've successfully built a \"Cinephile Translator\" that can converse with a single movie table, using an LLM to generate precise SQL queries. Now, as we begin Session 2, we’re ready to evolve our system into a truly powerful and production-ready data assistant. This session is dedicated to unlocking the full potential of our movie universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our first major challenge is to move beyond isolated tables. The real magic lies in the relationships between our movie data—the connections between actors, directors, and genres. We will master the **SQL `JOIN`** operation, learning to seamlessly navigate these relationships to answer sophisticated multi-table queries. From there, we’ll dive into **advanced analytics**, using powerful clauses like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` to extract deeper insights and rankings from our data, giving us the ability to go from simple facts to complex analytical summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we won’t stop at what pure SQL can do. We'll confront the **semantic gap**—the limitation of using keywords for conceptual searches—by introducing the concept of a **Hybrid RAG system**. We'll learn how to design an orchestration layer that intelligently combines structured SQL with a powerful vector-based semantic search, allowing us to answer highly subjective questions like finding a \"thrilling sci-fi\" film. Finally, we'll address the critical real-world challenges of **security, robustness, and performance**, ensuring our system is not only smart but also resilient, secure, and ready for deployment. This session will transform your foundational skills into the expertise needed to build a truly masterful Tabular RAG solution."

        "Learning SQL with SQLite is a fantastic way to grasp database fundamentals without the headache of setting up a complex server. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless database engine, which means it's incredibly easy to get started with. You can think of it as a database in a single file on your computer. 🚀\n",

        "\n",
        "## Why SQLite is Perfect for Beginners\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Zero Configuration:** There's no installation process or server to manage. You just download a single file and you're ready to go.\n",
        "  * **Portability:** Since your entire database (tables, data, and all) is stored in one file, you can easily copy, move, or email it.\n",
        "  * **Standard SQL:** SQLite uses a standard, widely understood version of the SQL language. The skills you learn with SQLite are directly transferable to more powerful database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.\n",

        "## Getting Started\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Download SQLite:** Go to the official [SQLite download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and grab the precompiled binary for your operating system. It's just a single executable file.\n",
        "2.  **Open the Command Line:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the SQLite file.\n",
        "3.  **Create a Database:** To create and open a new database file, simply type:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    sqlite3 my_first_database.db\n",
        "    ```\n",

        "\n",
        "### **CREATE TABLE**\n",
        "\n",
        "This command builds the structure, or \"schema,\" for your table. You define the columns and the type of data they will hold (e.g., `INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `REAL`).\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
        "    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    first_name TEXT,\n",

        "Here, `id` is the **primary key**, which is a unique identifier for each row.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **INSERT INTO**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have a table, you can add data (rows) into it using the `INSERT INTO` statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age) VALUES ('Alex', 'Smith', 22);\n",
        "INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age) VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe', 21);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **SELECT**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `SELECT` command is used to retrieve data. It's the command you'll use most often.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **To see all data:** The asterisk `*` is a wildcard for \"all columns.\"\n",
        "    ```sql\n",
        "    SELECT * FROM students;\n",
        "    ```\n",

        "    SELECT first_name, age FROM students WHERE age > 21;\n",
        "    ```\n",

        "    SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY last_name ASC; -- ASC for ascending, DESC for descending\n",

        "\n",
        "### **UPDATE**\n",
        "\n",
        "To modify data that's already in a table, use `UPDATE`. It's crucial to use a `WHERE` clause, otherwise, you'll update all rows in the table\\!\n",

        "\n",
        "### **DELETE**\n",

        "\n",

        "Once you're comfortable with these basic commands, you can explore more advanced topics:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Aggregate Functions:** Learn functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `MAX()` to perform calculations on your data.\n",
        "  * **GROUP BY:** Use this clause with aggregate functions to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.\n",
        "  * **GUI Tools:** Try a graphical user interface like **DB Browser for SQLite**. It allows you to see your database structure, browse data, and test queries in a more visual environment, which can be very helpful for learning."

Performing an operation in pandas and then figuring out the corresponding SQL query (or vice versa) is an incredibly effective way to solidify your understanding of both data manipulation paradigms."

This segment focuses on the practical aspects of taking the LLM's generated SQL string and running it using Python's sqlite3 module. We'll ensure the query is syntactically correct and then retrieve the raw results directly from the database. This is where the theoretical understanding of SQL generation transforms into tangible data retrieval."

You'll see the LLM generate multi-column queries, aggregate functions, and even filter data to retrieve the exact information we're looking for. This demo will visually reinforce how providing the schema empowers the LLM to provide richer and more insightful answers from our movie database.\n",

        "### The Connected World: Speaking Across Movie Tables\n",
        "So far, we've only talked to one movie table at a time. But the real power of a database comes from the relationships between its tables. Our movie universe is interconnected: a movie has a director, and a movie features several actors. This section introduces the concept of foreign keys as the \"glue\" that links our tables, allowing us to ask questions that span across the movies, actors, directors, cast_members, and movie_genres tables. We'll explore these relationships and set the stage for how we can navigate this web of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Glue: The Power of SQL JOINs\n",
        "To navigate the relationships between our movie tables, we use the JOIN operation. This powerful SQL command allows us to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, like a movie_id or an actor_id. We'll focus on the two most common types: the INNER JOIN, which finds matching data in both tables (e.g., which actors are in a specific movie), and the LEFT JOIN, which returns all records from one table even if there are no matches in the other (e.g., all movies, even those without a genre assigned).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Live Demo: Multi-Table Movie Query Magic\n",
        "This live demonstration brings our JOIN concepts to life. We'll present a natural language challenge like, \"List all actors who appeared in 'The Matrix'.\" You'll see how the LLM, now aware of our table relationships, generates a sophisticated SQL query that uses INNER JOIN to connect the movies table with the cast_members and actors tables. We'll execute this multi-table query and see how the LLM orchestrates the entire process to provide a comprehensive and accurate answer.\n",

        "### Beyond Simple Summaries: Advanced Aggregations\n",
        "We've learned to get simple totals with COUNT, but what if we want more nuanced insights? This section moves beyond basic summary statistics to advanced aggregations. We'll introduce the GROUP BY clause, a fundamental tool that lets us partition our data into groups based on a specific column (e.g., group all movies by genre). We'll then use COUNT and other aggregates within these groups to answer questions like, \"How many movies are in each genre?\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Filtering & Ranking Movie Data\n",
        "Once we've grouped our data, we often want to refine those results. This section introduces the HAVING clause, which allows us to filter the results of a GROUP BY operation based on a condition (e.g., \"show me only genres with more than 10 movies\"). We'll also cover the essential ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses, which let us sort our data and restrict the output to a specific number of records, enabling us to easily find top-ranked items like the \"top 5 longest movies.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Live Demo: Complex Aggregations & Ranking\n",
        "This live demonstration combines everything we've learned about advanced analytics. We'll pose a series of challenging natural language questions that require the LLM to use GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, and LIMIT in a single query. We'll also explore temporal queries using SQLite's date functions to answer questions like \"How many movies were released in each decade?\". You'll see how the LLM orchestrates these complex operations to provide a powerful and precise analytical summary of our movie data.\n",

This section introduces the concept of a Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that blends structured SQL queries with a powerful vector-based semantic search to bridge this gap and provide truly intelligent answers.\n",

We'll demonstrate a scenario: \"Find highly-rated sci-fi movies directed by Christopher Nolan with thrilling plots.\" The system will first use semantic search to find movie synopses with a \"thrilling plot\" and then use a structured SQL query to filter those results for \"sci-fi genre\" and \"Christopher Nolan.\" This workflow shows how we can combine the best of both worlds to generate a comprehensive and accurate response.\n",

        "We've covered a lot in Session 2! This section will provide a final recap of our journey. We'll quickly review the journey from our initial concepts and first queries to unlocking the power of schema and aggregates, mastering advanced queries with JOINs and GROUP BY, and conceptualizing a hybrid RAG system. This summary will reinforce the foundational principles and key techniques, ensuring you're confident in our progress.\n",

        "### Your Journey Continues\n",
        "As we conclude the session, we'll offer some final thoughts on the future of Tabular RAG and how you can continue to apply these concepts to your own data. The skills you've developed are not limited to our movie database; they are the foundation for building intelligent systems that can converse with any structured data source. We’ll offer guidance on how to scale these concepts beyond SQLite and into larger, more complex database environments."
